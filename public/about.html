    I'm 19 years old and a second-year college student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines taking a Bachelor Technology and Livelihood Education major in Information Communication Technology. I'm currently taking a course from Udemy on Web Development and this is one of the projects that I've created so far and continuing to learn more to become a web developer.
